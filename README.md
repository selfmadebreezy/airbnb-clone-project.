Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design is crucial for a booking system.  An intuitive interface reduces friction, allowing users to quickly find what they need and complete their transaction without confusion. A smooth process builds trust and encourages repeat use. Conversely, a confusing or complex design can lead to frustration, abandoned bookings, and a loss of potential customers. The design of this project prioritizes clarity and efficiency to ensure a positive user experience.
