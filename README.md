Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design is crucial for a booking system.  An intuitive interface reduces friction, allowing users to quickly find what they need and complete their transaction without confusion. A smooth process builds trust and encourages repeat use. Conversely, a confusing or complex design can lead to frustration, abandoned bookings, and a loss of potential customers. The design of this project prioritizes clarity and efficiency to ensure a positive user experience.

Core Components
Navbar: The navigation bar is a fixed element at the top of every page. It will include a logo, search bar, and user profile icons. This component is crucial for allowing users to navigate the site from any page.

Property Card: This component is the primary display for an individual property in the listing view. It will include a prominent image, the property's title, price per night, and a star rating. This design pattern allows users to quickly scan and compare different listings.

Footer: The footer is located at the bottom of the page and will contain important links and information. This includes links to "About Us," "Contact," "Terms of Service," and social media icons. It provides a consistent way for users to access key information no matter where they are on the site.
